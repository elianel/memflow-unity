To whom it may concern, ***I do not condone cheating***. This project has ***educational purposes only***.

### External Client Modifications for Unity Games built on [memflow](https://github.com/memflow/memflow). Bypasses kernel level anti-tamper solutions.

It's an example speed hack that can work on any ***Unity 2022.3.6f1 IL2CPP*** game. 

As I'm writing this it's still undetected by EasyAntiCheat.
